# Leaflet Challenge 
### Module 15

#### Objective
Utilize the USGS earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to map the past 7 days of Earthquake data utilizing Leaflet with Javascript.  

#### Plot Information
The map is available to view through [GitHub Pages](https://stephanielabelle.github.io/leaflet-challenge/), and [Javascript logic](static/js/logic.js) is provided in this repository.

That size of the datamarkers on the map reflect the magnitude of the Earthquake, and the depth is indicated by colour.  Pop-ups are utilized to provide additional information of the Earthquake.  Two tile options are available for visualization.
